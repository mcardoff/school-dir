\begin{frame}{Two Types of Lab Reports}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Long Reports
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If you took 19a last semester, reports like lab 3 and 6
    \item Longer form, use the template that will be posted to LATTE
    \item Graded on LATTE Rubric
    \end{itemize}
  \item Short Reports
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Questions provided in the lab manual
    \item Submission should include answers to the question in whatever way is easiest
    \end{itemize}
  \item For either form of Report, \textbf{Submit a PDF} and only a PDF
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Late Policy}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Points will be deducted based on how late your submission is
  \item 20\% will be deduced for each business day late your report is
  \item If Lab is due on Friday, and you submit it the next Monday, you will lose 20\% of the points you would have gotten    
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Resubmissions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You can resubmit all labs, with a caveat
  \item If you got above a 75\% on the lab, you cannot resubmit
  \item Resubmitted labs will take the average of the two scores you got as the final score
  \end{itemize}
