  Dear Bb,\\
  I love you so much, and I cannot believe that we have spent 5 years together. It does not feel like its enough for what we are. You are my actual best friend, even though we have only known each other for those short 5 years. I have known some people for almost my whole life, and I do not even have half the relationship that I have with you. You are the love of my life and I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for me. I know I need to change a lot, and I am working on being better for you, this I promise. Just know that you are the light of my life, the highlight of my day, and the best thing to happen to me, and you have been for what now is 5 whole years. \\
  Love,\\
  Bb, Booger, Baby, Smol Radish, Bestie, and ur Fav
