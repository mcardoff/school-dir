gcard.sty provides a simple LaTeX2e package for producing greeting cards.
It arranges four panels onto a single sheet (typically, A4 or letter)
so that when the sheet is folded twice the four panels are 
arranged as front cover, inside left and right pages, and back
cover.  It uses the textpos package for placement on the sheet
and the graphicx package for the necessary rotation. The four
panels are set in minipages for formatting by the user.

The package is distributed under the LaTeX Public Project License.
