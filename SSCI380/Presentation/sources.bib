 abstract = {This article examines the determinants of fertility, child mortality, and female disadvantage in child survival in India, using a district-level panel data set linking 1981 and 1991 censuses. The results question the dominant view that variables directly related to women's agency (specifically, the female literacy rate and the female labor force participation rate) have played the crucial roles here. Instead, variables reflecting the general level of development and modernization are shown to have had the greatest effect in reducing fertility and child mortality during the period of the study. Both economic development and women's agency are seen to have had significant effects in reducing the female disadvantage in child survival. The results suggest, however, that with continued economic development, the two women's agency variables lose their significance in influencing this disadvantage. The policy implications of these findings are considered.},

 abstract = {Using cross-country and panel regressions, this paper investigates how gender inequality hinders economic and human development: a one standard deviation change in the Multidimensional Gender Inequality Index (MGII) will increase long-run per capita income by 3.4\% and the Human Development Index (HDI) by 4.6\%. These results are mainly driven by inequalities in the identity dimension and in the access to economic activity for economic development, and by inequalities within the family and in the access to education for human development. Gender inequality may then explain differences in economic development: 10\% of the long-run income difference between South Asia and East Asia & the Pacific can be accounted for by the difference in gender inequality. Moreover, this paper provides evidence of a vicious circle between gender inequality and long term income. Gender inequality is measured by a composite index with endogenous weightings: the MGII. These results are robust to changes in specifications and controls for potential endogeneities. JEL: J16, O11, C43. / KEY WORDS: Growth, Gender Inequality, Development Economics.},

abstract = {Using the 2008 cross-sectional wave of the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey and multilevel modeling techniques, this article explores the macro-level determinants of the gender-poverty gap in the ten post-socialist EU member states. In dialogue with the literature on the impact of economic development on gender inequality in Asia and Latin America, we find that fast-paced, foreign capital-led economic growth is associated with a larger gender-poverty gap in Central and Eastern Europe, while generous welfare policies, specifically higher levels of spending on pensions and family policies, are correlated with women’s lower relative destitution. These findings evaluate the impact of neoliberal style "economic development" on gender inequality in a geopolitically specific context and suggest that structural adjustment and global market integration may exacerbate women’s vulnerability even when they are well equipped with human capital and other resources to compete with men in the labor market.},
