\maketitle
This week was a bit slow, I finally ended up going on to the VCL to try out the codes in proper MATLAB, when before I had been doing some testing in GNU Octave. It is nice to have the actual plots which we will end up using. I am finally able to meet with the team again officially since I am done with graduate school visits. This means we will get a lot more done.

In terms of the team, I know Stephanie finished creating the phantoms, so the hardware aspect will come in next so we get imaging done and we can actually make use of the curves I will be plotting. The paired agent imaging project was a good idea, and has a lot of interesting applications.
