\maketitle
My group is group 4 which includes myself, Nadia Netolicky, Stephanie Nguyen, and Eric Zacarias. I am NOT the person who submitted the slides. 

This week was fairly simple in terms of work. The group as a whole set up a discord server in order to communicate with each other quickly and effectively. Through this system we were able to set up a time in which we were all able to meet through the week and discuss what we wanted to work on, as well as another time which we needed to work on our presentation for the following Friday. This time we just set up a simple presentation for our research into the basic introductory topics for the week. We settled on two topics: The in vivo analysis during tumor removal, and the one regarding molecular targeted therapy and its use in metastatic diseases. One of my group members and I researched molecular targeted therapy while the others researched the other topic.

My time this week thus was mostly spent researching articles online discussing molecular targeted therapy. I found two specific articles which were helpful via Google Scholar. One was a fairly helpful article summarizing the developments (including the advantages and disadvantages) of molecular targeted therapies in recent times. The other dealt with the effect of treatments on metastatic cancers, specifically breast cancers. These articles helped to determine where we want our research to go in the future, especially in this early stage where we are still deciding what should be worked on in the coming semester. Through the next week we plan to decide what we want to work on specifically. If we decide to go into the first project, we will look into further roads there, looking into how we can incorporate smartphone technology into this specific topic, and see how currently available lens technology can be used to potentially identify cancerous cells within a tumor.
