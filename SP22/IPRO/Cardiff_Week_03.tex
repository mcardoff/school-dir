\maketitle

This week we had a new person join our group, Cassie, so we aimed to catch her up on what we have done so far. We essentially went through our week 2 presentation and explained the direction that we wanted to go in with everything, and make sure that we were all on the same page with everything. However before this we also decided to go along the margin analysis as opposed to molecular targetted therapy, as it seems that a lot of other groups were also doing margin analysis, so it would be a good collaboration opportunity especially if our group was struggling for ideas on something. This guided most of the research throughout the week as we now know the topic we are starting off on, so we can now move onto a method.

The research I had done this week involved how smartphones could be used in margin analysis in the first place. I found an article by Yun et al. which discussed the use of a mobile device in margin analysis of breast cancer tissue. The device used had a 5-megapixel camera and showed comparable results to the dedicated analysis device which was a lot more expensive. Specifically the authors called their results 'comparable' and showed hopeful results. Most importantly however their sample size was very small, as it was a retroactive study with a very small sample size. It would be a bit more useful if the article had covered multiple types of cancers at various stages.

My other partners were able to find specific technologies to turn basic smartphone cameras into miscroscopes capable of margin analysis. This is a good step in the right deirection as we move on further into the semester. We were able to find a number of particularly cheap yet effective ways to perform fluorescent analysis on smartphone cameras, so we will probably dig deeper into those throughout the week.
