\maketitle
This week was a little tough at least with respect to team things. We met multiple times this week to discuss the future of our project, as we feel as if we are at somewhat of a crossroads at our project. We wanted to see if we should continue along the path of implementing the microscope technology on a smartphone or deal with actual problems in the imaging itself. While the initial idea we had was for the former, we have a definite interest in pursuing the second, as it has a bit better implications for other projects. Despite this, I still would continue with some sort of kinetic model no matter what.

I wanted to look more into the implications and assumptions in kinetic modeling this week. The compartmental model is really similar to something I looked at a lot in differential equations, with flow going in and out of various containers. Due to the assumption that the tracer we have moves with whatever it attaches to in a homogeneous way, so we really are modeling the flow of the so called tracee. This is an interesting assumption to look into, but is good enough for a basic modeling purpose. I believe the relevant things to model are at least the blood \& tissue as well as the plasma. A similar model to the one in the paper can be used since the head is studied in that paper as well. This coming Week I hope to focus on the examples that Dr Tichauer will present in the kinetic modeling workshop this Friday.
